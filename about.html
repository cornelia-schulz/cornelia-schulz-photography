			<h3 class="white">ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p class="justify">Quite simply, I just love taking photos. Blending this with my fascination with the natural world provides me with heaps of inspiration.</p>
			<p class="justify">I feel lucky too, just having moved to New Zealand, a breathtaking and beautiful country with such huge diversity of natural elements, wildlife and seasons!</p>
			<p class="justify">My philosophy is a simple one - keep things as real as possible. I think my style of photography is very natural and expressive, after all photography is about capturing mood, expression and emotion through the lens and portraying them with an artistic vision. It is about telling your story through beautiful images.</p>
